I am an assistant professor at [School of Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu), [Georgia
Tech](http://www.gatech.edu).  I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu) under the
advisement of [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj). 

My research area is data mining and machine learning. I am particularly
interested in developing label-efficient and robust learning techniques, with
applications in text mining and spatiotemporal data mining.

I am actively looking for talented and motivated students to work with me.
Please email me if you are interested.
