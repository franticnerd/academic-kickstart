I am a final-year PhD student at the [Computer Science
Department](http://cs.illinois.edu/) of [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), advised by
[Prof. Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj). My research falls in the area
of data mining and machine learning.  The overarching goal of my research is to
enable machines to turn massive data into actionable insights and intelligent
decisions *faster* and *with less supervision*.  My current work emphasizes on
text and spatiotemporal data, with applications in smart city and health
informatics.


**Notice:** I will join [School of Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu) at [Georgia
Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) as an assistant professor from December 2018. I am
actively looking for talented and motivated students to work with me. Please
email me if you are interested.
