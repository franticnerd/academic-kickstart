I work on machine learning for **unstructured text data** and its applications,
with emphasis on improving **label efficiency** and **robustness** of learning
algorithms.  Methodologically, I am particularly interested in
weakly-supervised learning ([CIKM'18](/papers/cikm18a.pdf),
[AAAI'19](/papers/aaai19.pdf)), unsupervised learning
([ICML'19](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19h.html)), probabilistic
models ([KDD'19](/publication)), and uncertainty estimation
([UbiComp'18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02980.pdf)).  

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), where I
worked with [Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj) on text mining
([KDD'17](/papers/kdd17.pdf), [KDD'18](/papers/kdd18a.pdf),
[ICDM'18](/papers/icdm18.pdf)) and spatiotemporal data mining
([VLDB'14](/papers/pvldb14.pdf), [KDD'15](/papers/kdd15.pdf),
[KDD'16](/papers/kdd16.pdf), [KDD'17](/papers/kdd17a.pdf),
[SIGIR'16](/papers/sigir16.pdf), [WWW'17](/papers/www17.pdf)).

**For prospective students:** We have openings for strong and motivated
students.  If you are interested in joining my group, please send me an email
along with your CV and transcript.  I may not be able to respond to all the
inquiries due to the large volume of them, but I will contact you if there is a
good match between us.


### What's New:
