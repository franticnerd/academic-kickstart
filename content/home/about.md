I am an assistant professor at [School of Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu), [Georgia
Tech](http://www.gatech.edu).  I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu) under the
advisement of [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj). 


My research is to build intelligent systems that acquire knowledge from data
for effective task support and decision making. Towards this goal, much of my
recent work has been centered around **mining unstructured data** (text, time
series), with particular emphasis on developing techniques that learn from data
in a **label-efficient** and **robust** way. I am also broadly interested in
**weakly-supervised learning**, **probabilistic models**, and **uncertainty
estimation**.

I am actively looking for talented and motivated students to work with me.
Please email me if you are interested.
