I am an incoming assistant professor at [School of Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu), [Georgia
Tech](http://www.gatech.edu).  I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu) under the
advisement of [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj). 

My research interests fall in the area of data mining and machine learning. My
current work focuses on developing label-efficient and robust methods that turn
massive data (e.g., text, spatiotemporal data) into knowledge for task support
and decision making.

I am actively looking for talented and motivated students to work with me.
Please email me if you are interested.
