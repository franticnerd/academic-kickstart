I am an incoming assistant professor at [School of Computational Science and
Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu), [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu)
from January 2019.  I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu) under the
advisement of [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj). 

My research falls in the area of data mining and machine learning.  The
overarching goal of my research is to enable machines to turn massive data into
actionable insights and intelligent decisions *with less supervision* and
*faster*.  My current work emphasizes on semi-supervised learning, deep
learning, text mining, and spatiotemporal data mining.

I am actively looking for talented and motivated students to
work with me. Please email me if you are interested.
