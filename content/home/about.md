My research areas are data mining and machine learning.  My recent work centers
around acquiring knowledge from **unstructured text data**, with emphasis on
improving **label efficiency** and **robustness** of learning algorithms.
Methodologically, I am particularly interested in weakly-supervised learning
([CIKM'18](/papers/cikm18a.pdf), [AAAI'19](/papers/aaai19.pdf)), unsupervised
learning ([ICML'19](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19h.html)),
probabilistic models ([KDD'19](/publication)), and uncertainty estimation
([UbiComp'18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02980.pdf)).  

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), where I
worked with [Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj) on **text mining**
([KDD'17](/papers/kdd17.pdf), [KDD'18](/papers/kdd18a.pdf),
[ICDM'18](/papers/icdm18.pdf)) and **spatiotemporal data mining**
([VLDB'14](/papers/pvldb14.pdf), [KDD'15](/papers/kdd15.pdf),
[KDD'16](/papers/kdd16.pdf), [KDD'17](/papers/kdd17a.pdf),
[SIGIR'16](/papers/sigir16.pdf), [WWW'17](/papers/www17.pdf)).

**For prospective students:** We have openings for strong and motivated
students.  If you are interested in joining my group, please send me an email
along with your CV and transcript.  I may not be able to respond to all the
inquiries due to the large volume of them, but I will contact you if there is a
good match between us.


### What's New:

* Our paper "TopicMine: User-Guided Topic Mining by Category-Oriented Embedding" is accepted by KDD 2019 Projects Showcase for oral presentation!
* Our paper "State-sharing Sparse Hidden Markov Models" for modeling sparse sequential data is accepted by KDD 2019 as an oral paper in the research track!
* Our paper "A gradual, semi-discrete approach to generative network training via explicit Wasserstein minimization" is accepted by ICML 2019!
* Our book "Multidimensional Mining of Massive Text Data" has been published by Morgan & Claypool! Check it out [here](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/10.2200/S00903ED1V01Y201902DMK017).
* Two papers are accepted by SDM 2019. One is about using hidden Markov model for mobility modeling; another about cross-modal linking between text and location.
* The [code](https://github.com/yumeng5/WeSTClass) for our [CIKM paper](/papers/cikm18a.pdf) on weakly-supervised text classification is released. If you want to use deep neural nets to do text classification but don't have much labeled data, try it out!
* Our paper on weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification is accepted by AAAI 2019.
* Our paper on linear-time trajectory similarity computation is accepted by ICDE 2019. It's up to 100x faster than state-of-the-art trajectory similarity computation techniques and supports all major measures! Code will be out soon.
* One paper on weakly-supervised text classification is accepted by CIKM 2018. No need for excessive training data but just a few seeds. Congrats Yu!
* One paper on open-domain event extraction is accepted by CIKM 2018.
* One paper on text cube construction without labeled data is accepted by ICDM 2018.
* Delivered a tutorial and presented three papers in KDD 2018@London.
* Our paper on using GAN for semi-supervised learning is accepted by IMWUT 2018.
* We will give a tutorial on multidimensional analysis of text data ([website](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/2018-04-21-kdd-tutorial/)) in KDD 2018.
* One paper on event detection is accepted by ASONAM 2018.
* Three papers are accepted by KDD 2018 (Research Track).
* Invited to talk about event detection on Illinois Innovator Podcast, available on [SoundCloud](https://engineering.illinois.edu/news/article/23905) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/engineering-at-illinois/id1237376461?mt=2).
* Serving on the Program Committee (Machine Learning Track) of ACL 2018.
* Check out our [Urbanity](http://urbanity-frontend.herokuapp.com/) system ([paper](/papers/cikm17c.pdf)) for predicting spatiotemporal activities with social media.
* We give a tutorial on "Space and Time Coupled Social Media Analysis" ([slides](/slides/slides-cikm17.pdf)) in CIKM'17. 
* Check out the [report](http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/tweet-analysis-could-pinpoint-where-to-send-emergency-help-in-disasters-like-harvey/94590) from [IT Business](http://www.itbusiness.ca/about-us) about our work on event detection from social media.
