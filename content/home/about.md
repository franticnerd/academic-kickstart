My research areas are data mining and machine learning.  My recent work centers
around acquiring knowledge from **unstructured text data**, with emphasis on
improving **label efficiency** and **robustness** of learning algorithms.
Methodologically, I am particularly interested in weakly-supervised learning
([CIKM'18](/papers/cikm18a.pdf), [AAAI'19](/papers/aaai19.pdf)), unsupervised
learning ([ICML'19](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19h.html)),
probabilistic models ([KDD'19](/publication)), and uncertainty estimation
([UbiComp'18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02980.pdf)).  

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer
Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/) from [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), where I
worked with [Jiawei Han](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj) on **text mining**
([KDD'17](/papers/kdd17.pdf), [KDD'18](/papers/kdd18a.pdf),
[ICDM'18](/papers/icdm18.pdf)) and **spatiotemporal data mining**
([VLDB'14](/papers/pvldb14.pdf), [KDD'15](/papers/kdd15.pdf),
[KDD'16](/papers/kdd16.pdf), [KDD'17](/papers/kdd17a.pdf),
[SIGIR'16](/papers/sigir16.pdf), [WWW'17](/papers/www17.pdf)).

**For prospective students:** We have openings for strong and motivated
students.  If you are interested in joining my group, please send me an email
along with your CV and transcript.  I may not be able to respond to all the
inquiries due to the large volume of them, but I will contact you if there is a
good match between us.
