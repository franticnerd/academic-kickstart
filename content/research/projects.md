### Research interests

Our research goal is to enable machines to *turn massive data into actionable
insights and intelligent decisions faster and with less supervision*.
Revolving around this goal, we study the following topics in data mining and
machine learning:  
- **Data Mining**: text mining; spatiotemporal data mining; time series analysis  
- **Machine Learning**: semi-supervised learning; few-shot learning; deep learning
