### Research interests

We aim to enable machines to acquire knowledge from massive data in a
label-efficient and robust way, as well as use the acquired knowledge for task
support and decision making. Revolving around this goal, we study the following
topics:  
  - Low-resource text mining  
  - Learning with less labeled data  
  - Probabilistic modeling and uncertainty quantification
