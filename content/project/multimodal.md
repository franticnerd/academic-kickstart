Text--—the major data form for encoding information, and space and time—--the
two most important contexts of our physical world, are increasingly converging.
Existing text mining and spatiotemporal data mining techniques operate
separately and quickly become obsolete in dealing with such complex data.  How
do we unveil the subtle correlations between different modalities?  How do we
discover interesting patterns in the multidimensional space? Can we integrate
different modalities to make more accurate predictions?  In this project, we
strive to **connect multiple modalities (text, space, time) in a principled
way**, thus improving predictive analysis and decision making in context-rich
scenarios.  We study several key problems such as **cross-modal prediction**
and **multimodal sequential prediction** in this pursuit.

It connects multiple modalities to model human activities in the physical world
with massive social media data.
